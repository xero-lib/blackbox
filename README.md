Finally, an embedded-friendly, memory-safe, and underrun-resistent audio-playback buffer!

Currently uses CPAL to hook high-level audio device abstractions, but will also implement direct-to-hardware interfaces for embedded applications.

Plans are also in the works to add video support, both for screen and camera.
